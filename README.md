So yea, this used to be the cheat for a while. Now archived, this was a fork to preserve the original code I think? Honestly, it's been a long time and I have forgotten what this even is. Going from the variable "reukeRunScript", it's safe to assume this was an early version of Surviv Cheat Injector, which at the time was an upgraded version of Reuke and Kalaborative's Surviv-Cheat.

Been a while, hasn't it? Thanks for sticking around.
